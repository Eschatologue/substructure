A mindustry mod containing examples to show what scripted contents can do. This branch is the Java version for this mod, click [here](https://github.com/Gdeft/substructure/tree/6.0) to see the JavaScript version branch.

## Building

Substructure builds are automatically generated by the Java CI, you can just download the JAR file of this mod through the [Actions tab](https://github.com/Gdeft/substructure/actions). Go to the latest workflow and download the ZIP file from the Artifacts section. Unzip the file after it has been downloaded and import the JAR file to where your `mods/` directory is [1].

If you want to build or compile it yourself, follow these instructions.

1. Install [JDK 14](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) if you haven't.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
3. Open terminal then `cd` to where the cloned/downloaded repository was.

On Windows, you can open the terminal by pressing `Win + R` then typing `cmd` then pressing the enter key. You can open the terminal by pressing `Ctrl + Option + Shift + T` if you are on MacOS. I assume you already know how to open the terminal in Linux-based operating system already, if you are using one.

If you are also compiling for Android, you need to download Android SDK (just the command-line tools only). Set the 'ANDROID_HOME' environment variable to where it's located. Make sure that you have API Level 30 installed, then add the 'build-tools/${version}' to your 'PATH' environment variable [2].

### Gradle Tasks

- _Building (Desktop):_ `gradlew core:jar`
- _Building (Desktop + Android):_ `gradlew core:deploy`
- _Generating Sprites:_ `gradlew tools:gen`

Build outputs are located in `core/build/libs/`.
